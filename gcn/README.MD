# Graal Cloud Native Tools

[Graal Cloud Native](https://graal.cloud/) is a cloud-agnostic development framework, built on top of
[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/). Using Graal Cloud Native you can write once and then run the same code on multiple cloud platforms.

This extension provides a wizard to easily create a new Graal Cloud Native project.

It is recommended to install [Graal Cloud Native Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graal-cloud-native-pack) which contains this extension and others.

    - Select an Application type
    - Select an installed JDK
    - Provide a name for the project
    - Provide a base package
    - Pick the Graal Cloud Native services to be included in the project
    - Select a build tool: Maven or Gradle
    - Select a unit test framework: JUnit, Spock, or Kotest
    - Select cloud providers to support: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and/or Amazon Web Services; Note: you need to select OCI if you want OCI DevOps support

3. Finally, you are asked where to save your new project. You then choose to open it in a new VS Code window or add it to a Workspace in the current VS Code window.

You now have a new Graal Cloud Native application, complete with example code showing you how to start using [Graal Cloud Native](https://graal.cloud/).
