# OCI DevOps Tools

Enables easy integration with the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) DevOps](https://www.oracle.com/devops/devops-service/) service. The DevOps service can host your source code in the Oracle Cloud and build, then deploy, your projects in hosted CI/CD pipelines.

The extension creates a project in the DevOps service, sets up a source code repository, as well as build and deployment pipelines, enabling you to easily transition from local to cloud-based development and deployment.

## Quickstart

If you are working with a Graal Cloud Native (or Spring Boot) project, the extension will setup build pipelines to build Java and GraalVM Native Image
based containers. Deployment pipelines will be created that will deploy these containers to an OKE cluster.

If you have a normal Maven or Gradle project, you can still use this extension to build
your JARs in the cloud on the OCI DevOps service, but as of now deployment pipelines are not created.

To find out more about [Graal Cloud Native](https://graal.cloud/) and the [OCI DevOps service](https://www.oracle.com/devops/devops-service/) see these links.

To get started, you will need:

- To install the extension
- Have a Java installation (JDK 17+)
- Have an [Oracle Cloud account](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) (a free account is OK)
- [Create an .oci/config file](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) to access OCI services
- [Add an API Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/generate_ssh_keys/index.html)
- [Install the OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)
- [Create and setup access to an OKE cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcreatingclusterusingoke.htm). OKE is Oracle's managed Kubernetes service.

Having done the above, and with a [Graal Cloud Native](https://graal.cloud/), or a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io), project, you can
can now create an OCI DevOps project.

### <a name='create-devops-project'></a>Create DevOps Project

1. Open **OCI DEVOPS SERVICES** panel in VSCode Explorer and click Create DevOps Project button

    ![devops-ci-jobs.png](images/create_devops_prj.png)

2. You will be guided through the process of creating an OCI DevOps project:
    - Select your comparment in OCI. Your DevOps project will be created here.
    - Confirm the DevOps project name. This must be unique to the tenancy.
    - Depending on your setup, you might be asked to:
        - Confirm the SSH keys for git operations and add the OCI DevOps git server to your SSH **config** and **known_hosts** file.
        - Select an existing OKE cluster on OCI, or create a new one using the [OKE Quick Create](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcreatingclusterusingoke_topic-Using_the_Console_to_create_a_Quick_Cluster_with_Default_Settings.htm#create-quick-cluster) action.

    - When the new OKE cluster is created, configure local access to the OKE Kubernetes cluster using the `VNC-Native Public Endpoint`. This is done using the OCI CLI and you may have already done this in the prerequisite steps.

Once you create a DevOps project, the following build targets now become available from within VS Code:

![devops-ci-jobs.png](images/devops-ci-jobs.png)

You can run these build targets, which will run in the Cloud in the OCI DevOps service and not locally, by clicking on the triangle run icon.

### <a name='default-pipelines-setup'></a>Default Pipelines Setup

* **Build OCI Native Executable Container**: Packages the application as a native executable in a container image.
* **Build OCI JVM Container**: Packages the application as a JVM-based container image.

Once built, the container images can be pulled by clicking on the cloud icon, which provides the command required to pull the containers locally.

The build specification files for each pipeline are stored in `.devops/`. If you update the build specification file, commit and push
the change to the DevOps-hosted repository, the build pipelines will be updated to reflect this change.

## <a name='oci-kubernetes-deployment-with-oke'></a>OCI Kubernetes deployment with OKE

When the build pipeline succeeds, the container image can be deployed to OKE using **Deploy OCI Docker Native Executable Container to OKE**
deployment pipeline. When complete, the application can be tested in a browser by selecting the action **Open in Browser** for Deploy pipeline. This will
set up port forwarding using your local `kubectl`.

![Open OKE application in local browser](images/oke_test_app.png)

It will perform **kubectl** port forwarding from OKE to localhost as indicated by the VSCode status bar.

## <a name='project-dependencies-vulnerability-audits'></a>Project Dependencies Vulnerability Audits

The extension also performs project audits for vulnerabilities in 3rd party project libraries; supported project types are Maven and Gradle. Project Audits require an OCI account (**.oci/config** file) and uses OCI ADM Knowledgebase which retrieves data from the nvd.nist.gov database.
Just select **Run Project Audit** action in the Java Projects panel to check for vulnerabilities in an opened project. If a project contains a vulnerable dependency, it is shown in the PROBLEMS view.

![Project Audits action and reported errors](images/project_audit.png)

When your project is moved into the DevOps service in the OCI Cloud, it is scanned for vulnerabilities by the [Application Dependency Management service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/application-dependency-management/home.htm).
The results of this audit can be displayed within the OCI DevOps Services panel by clicking on the plus icon and selecting, "Add Knowledge Base", from the
displayed menu.

## <a name='adding-more-oci-devops-services'></a>Adding more OCI DevOps Services
The **OCI DEVOPS SERVICES** feature is not limited by the four jobs listed in the previous step. There are many more: You can
add an existing build pipeline, a build artifact, a container registry, etc.

## <a name='prerequisites'></a>Pre-requisites

- [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) Microsoft extension
- [Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) Microsoft extension
â€‹
> Note: The extension depends on the [Apache NetBeans Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ASF.apache-netbeans-java), [GraalVM Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graalvm-pack). (VS Code installs these required extensions for you.)

## <a name='proxy-setup'></a>Proxy Setup
When working behind firewall over proxy then VSCode Proxy has to be set ON. In VSCode **Settings** set **Http: Proxy Support** to **ON**. Subsequently when working without proxy set this **OFF**.

![HTTP Proxy in VSCode](images/proxy.png)

Many tools used to work on Java projects, like Maven, Gradle, kubectl and Docker (if used), could require setting up proxy configuration.
