To submit pull requests to vscode-extensions, you need to sign the [Oracle Contributor
Agreement][1].

Project members with write access to the repository will determine
and assign an appropriate [Assignee][2] for the pull request. The
assignee will work with the pull request owner to address any issues
and then merge the pull request.
